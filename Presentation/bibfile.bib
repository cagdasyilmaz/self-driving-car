	abstract="A new way of representing tyre data obtained from measurements in pure cornering and pure braking conditions has been developed in order to further improve the Dynamic Safety of vehicles. The method makes use of a formula with coefficients which describe some of the typifying quantities of a tyre, such as slip stiffnesses at zero slip and force and torque peak values. The formula is capable of describing the characteristics of side force, brake force and self aligning torque with great accuracy. This mathematical representation is limited to steady-state conditions during either pure cornering or pure braking and forms the basis for a model describing tyre behaviour during combined braking and cornering.",
